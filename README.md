⚠️ **Project Status: In Progress**

BasodinoBot is a toolkit for generating words in a constructed language (conlang) called *Basodino* using Latin source vocabulary. It includes:

- A Wiktionary scraper for Latin verbs
- A sound change engine that applies phonological transformations based on Old High German 
- IPA handling and rule-based reformulation

## 💡 Purpose

This project blends linguistics, conlang creation, and code. It's a personal language engineering project designed to evolve into a chatbot that can speak and teach Basodino.

## ✅ Current Features

- Scrapes Latin verbs and their IPA from Wiktionary
- Applies a defined set of vowel and consonant shifts
- Outputs transformed IPA strings representing Basodino words

## 🔜 Planned Features

- GUI or CLI for word generation
- Full dictionary builder
- Chatbot interface with grammar rules and translation
- spaCy-style tagging for machine learning and glossing

## 📂 Folders

- `examples/`: Latin-to-Basodino transformation examples and IPA logs

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack

- Python (requests, BeautifulSoup)
- IPA string manipulation
- Linguistic rule application
- Planned: LLM training, chatbot front-end

## 🌍 What Is Basodino?

Basodino is a fictional language inspired by Romance languages and designed with naturalistic sound changes, custom grammar, and a distinct lexicon. This bot builds its evolving vocabulary.
